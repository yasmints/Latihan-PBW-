                Strawberries are sweet supple red fruit with surfaces that are seed-
                studded. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus 
                Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed 
                foliage, and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.
                <br>
                <br>
                They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). There 
                are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel; 
                all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow 
                seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and stalk that 
                embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit.

            <p>
                The word strawberry is coined from "strewn” berries about the plants 
                and thus the “strewn berry” finally turned into “Strawberry” (Roger). They are 
                not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant. 
                The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There 
                are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are 
                non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium 
                (Roger).

                Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like, 
                stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries 
                were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth, 
                and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is 
                at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very 
                well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).

                Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses of 
                strawberries is being used as recipe or an ingredient in preparation of 
                drinks, meals or snacks. Strawberries are used as ingredients in many 
                types of foods like cakes, yoghurts, desserts, salads, juices, meals and
